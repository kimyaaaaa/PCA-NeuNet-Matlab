# PCA-Neural Network-Matlab on a cats/dogs dataset
Pattern recognition project using PCA as a feature extraction method and Neural Network as a classifier to classify between cats and dogs' images, the project was implemented on matlab. The program simply reduces the dimensions of the images and computes a linear combination of all images to be able later to represent the whole dataset in one, two or more principal components. Based on our analysis we decide to choose a number of principal components that would be later used in the neural network model as input. The Neural Network is a classifier to differentiate between cats and dogs
# To Install and run the project
You need Matlab r2020a or a newer version installed on your PC.
Download the dataset.
Download the mlx files ( live editor script on matlab), you may also download the implementation.txt file and run the code in a script file on matlab.
